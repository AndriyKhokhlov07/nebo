        "notes": "The well-being of our guests is our top priority, and we're committed to providing a safe environment for members at all Outpost houses as the novel coronavirus pandemic continues to evolve. We're following expert recommendations within our houses to ensure your safety, including by leaving rooms empty for at least 24 hours after a move-out, providing our staff with appropriate PPE and using high-strength Lysol/Clorox and bleach disinfectants (or alternatives) to clean after every guest departure. We'll continue to adapt our strategies moving forward to ensure the health and safety of all of our members.\nAlso:\n1) we will request your phone and email address to add you to the remote lock system and to our maintenance portal\n2) we will send you links to electronically sign our COVID form. The state government requires us to collect COVID related information for tracing purposes. \n3) upon arrival, we will request to check the photo ID's of each person that moves into the apartment to ensure safety of all members in the property. \n4) we may have security cameras in place - in common and public hallways, basements; in shared apartments, we may have cameras in living areas - in the kitchens and living rooms overlooking the kitchen and living room with 24/7 recording.\n\nWe care about the well-being and safety of all our tenants, and because of this, we request that everyone who lives at our spaces complete a Transunion background check. The background screening will not impact your credit score, and it’s free for you to complete. We will send you the link after you complete your reservation, along with a COVID waiver form, that is required by authorities for COVID tracing. For International guests we will request a copy of the valid USA visa.\n\nOutpost Club does not accept bookings by one person for other people (third party bookings). If you would like to book an Outpost Club property, you must use your own Airbnb account to do so. During the move in, Outpost Club will require the person booking to present the same identification attached to the airbnb account. The only exception to this rule is for group bookings, though the person booking still must be part of the group moving in. If you are a parent who books for your children, but you will not stay in the property yourself, we will request you to pass a Transunion background check as well as sign guarantor agreement for your children.",
