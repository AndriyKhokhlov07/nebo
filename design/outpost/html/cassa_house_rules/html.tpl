<h2>Enforcement of Rules and Consequences of Violations</h2>
<p>For good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement who have signed at the bottom of this document hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p>Cassa Studios does not monitor its Guests and would never want Guests to feel monitored. Cassa Studios&rsquo;s goal is to make Guests feel at home from the moment arrive to the moment they leave. In order to preserve this feeling of home, Cassa Studios has the rules outlined in this Guestship agreement to communicate our vision of what home should be: respectful, clean, comfortable space to connect with others.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this Guests must not only follow the rules, but report to Cassa Studios management when and if rules are being broken. Cassa Studios can not enforce violations of rules by its Guests that it is not aware of, therefore it is your responsibility as a Guest to notify us when something is bothering you.</p>
<p>Please report all violations of the rules to customer.service@outpost-club.com, or contact your House Leader or Community Manager directly. When reporting please include the time, place, and description of the violation. If the person reporting knows who is involved, we&rsquo;d appreciate it if the person reporting provides that information as well but understand if they do not want to. Please understand that we are not able to resolve the issue if we do not know who commits the violation.</p>
<p>If Cassa Studios has reason to believe that a Guest has broken the rules, Cassa Studios reserves the right to issue warnings, and in circumstances where the violation is heinous and/or is a threat to the community, Cassa Studios reserves the right to discontinue Guestship after warnings or immediately.</p>
<p>If the Guest has this agreement up as a couple, the Guest signing this agreement is responsible for the actions of the other Guest in the couple&rsquo;s relationship. All violations of this agreement by either Guest of the couple are violations by the entire couple.</p>
