<p><strong>Damage/Loss Charges</strong></p>
<p>Individual Tenant is responsible for damages to his/her Apartment Unit, as well as damage and/or loss to the furnishings, fixtures, equipment, appliances and other property Lessor has provided, which are caused by the acts or omissions of such Individual Tenant, and his or her Authorized Occupants, guests and invitees. Individual Tenant agrees to pay for the restoration of the property to its condition at the time of initial occupancy or for repairs or replacement (except normal wear and tear), unless the identity of others responsible, including other Individual Tenants and their Authorized Occupants, guests and invitees, for the damage or loss is established and proven by Individual Tenant. This responsibility extends until the Apartment Unit is officially returned to Lessor as provided above. If the responsible party for the damages cannot be determined, charges for damages, cleaning, replacement of furniture, etc. shall be divided by the number of Individual Tenants leasing the Apartment Unit. If one or more Individual Tenants or their Authorized Occupants assume responsibility for damages, cleaning, replacement of furniture, etc., a written statement signed by the responsible party must be noted in writing and delivered to Lessor at the time of surrendering occupancy. Charges will not be assessed to one Individual Tenant based solely on another Individual Tenant's claim of wrongdoing. Individual Tenant should assure that all windows and doors to the Apartment Unit are locked and secured at all times and when vacating the Apartment Unit. It is understood that Individual Tenants are responsible for any damage or loss caused or non-routine cleaning or trash removal required to the common areas of the Apartment Building and their furnishings, including vending machines and other equipment placed in the Apartment Building as a convenience to Individual Tenants and Authorized Occupants. Common areas outside of Apartment Units may include corridors, recreation rooms, kitchens, study rooms, living rooms, laundry rooms, public bathrooms, lounges, terraces, roof top terraces, entry corridors and pavement in front of the Apartment Building, as specified for the Apartment Building on the Outpost website. When damage occurs, Individual Tenant(s) will be billed directly for the repairs. Lessor shall have the authority to assess and assign charges for these damages as set forth in the Fee Catalogue.</p>
