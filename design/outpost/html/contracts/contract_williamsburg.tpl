<li>
	<h2>SECURITY DEPOSIT</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Each Individual Tenant is required to deposit with Lessor the sum specified in the signature page of such Individual Tenant when such Individual Tenant signs this Lease as a security deposit (the "Security Deposit"), which is called in law a trust. Lessor will deposit this Security Deposit in Bank of America, which is located within the State of New York. If the Apartment Building contains six or more Apartments Units, the bank account holding the Security Deposit will earn interest, as prescribed by the law of the State of New York. Alternatively, Tenant may utilize Hello Rented, who will either hold the security deposit, or provide the alternate form of security as outlined in a separate agreement between Tennant and Hello Rented.</li>
	<li>In the event that your rent increases at the time of Lease renewal, the Lessor may also require an increase in the Security Deposit and you will be required to place additional funds in the Security Deposit. The Security Deposit will be held as security for performance of all your obligations under this Lease and is not intended to be a reserve from which fees, charges, rent and additional rent may be paid. In the event you owe Lessor other fees or charges, in addition to the rent, you may not rely on deducting them from the Security Deposit, but must pay them separately.</li>
	<li>The Security Deposit, and any interest accrued thereon (to the extent applicable), or any balance remaining after deducting outstanding rent, fees and other costs due to Lessor, will be returned to you as an Individual Tenant no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after you as an Individual Tenant have vacated the Apartment Unit following the termination or expiration of this Lease with respect to you as an Individual Tenant, subject to the complete satisfaction of all of your Individual Tenant's obligations under this Lease. In the event that you, as an Individual Tenant, relocate to another Apartment Unit, you will need to post a new Security Deposit and execute a new lease. The Security Deposit is refundable except as otherwise expressly stated in this Lease.</li>
	<li>If you as an Individual Tenant carry out all of your agreements in this Lease and you move out of the Apartment Unit and return it to Lessor along with the furnishings and items provided by Lessor in the same condition it was in when you first occupied it, except for ordinary wear and tear or damage caused by fire or other casualty not the fault of you, Lessor will return to you as an Individual Tenant your Security Deposit and any interest to which you are entitled once Lessor or its managing agent has inspected the Apartment Unit and within fourteen (14) days after the vacancy of the Apartment Unit by you as an Individual Tenant. However, if you do not carry out all your agreements in this Lease, Lessor may keep all or part of your Security Deposit and any interest which has not yet been paid to you necessary to pay Lessor for any losses incurred, including for unpaid rent and damage to the Apartment Unit beyond normal wear and tear and any item in the Inventory List. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if another Individual Tenant is moving out of the Apartment Unit and through Lessor's inspection determines that there is damage to the Apartment Unit or furnishings or items listed in the Inventory List caused by you, Lessor may charge your Security Deposit for the cost of such damage and require you to replenish the Security Deposit to the full Security Deposit amount.</li>
	<li>If Lessor sells and/or assigns this Lease, Lessor will turn over your Security Deposit, with interest, to purchaser or assignee of this Lease. Lessor will then have no further responsibility to you for your Security Deposit. The new lessor will become responsible to you for the Security Deposit.</li>

If Lessor unreasonably refuses to consent to an assignment or subletting requested in writing by you in the manner required by law (Real Property Law section 226-b), then you may continue as an Individual Tenant, sublet, or assign this Lease, but only to another person that has signed a Lease, or at your request in writing, Lessor will end this Lease and release you from further liability. The first and every other time you wish to assign your Lease, sublet the Apartment Unit or permit anyone else to use it, you must get the written consent of Lessor. Lessor may impose a service charge on you in connection with any approved assignment or subletting. Lessor may collect rent from the assignee, subtenant or occupant if you fail to pay your rent. Lessor will credit the amount collected against the rent due from you. However, Lessor's acceptance of such rent does not change the status of the assignee, subtenant or occupant if you fail to pay your rent. Lessor will credit the amount collected against the rent due from you. However, Lessor's acceptance of such rent does not change the status of the assignee, subtenant or occupant to that of direct tenant of Lessor and does not release you from this Lease.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>These steps must be followed by Individual Tenants wishing to sublet:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The Individual Tenant must send a written request to the Lessor by certified mail, return receipt requested. The request must contain the following information: (a) the length of the sublease; (b) the name, home and business address of the proposed subtenant; (c) the reason for subletting; (d) the tenant's address during the sublet; (e) the written consent of any co-tenant or guarantor; (f) a copy of the proposed sublease together with a copy of the tenant's own lease, if available, (g) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lessor that subtenant has passed a criminal background check and financial credit review equivalent to Lessor's requirements for Individual Tenants.</li>
			<li>Within ten (10) days after the mailing of this request, the Lessor may ask the Individual Tenant for additional information to help make a decision. Any request for additional information may not be unduly burdensome.</li>
			<li>Within thirty (30) days after the mailing of the Individual Tenant's request to sublet or the additional information requested by the Lessor, whichever is later, the Lessor must send the Individual Tenant a notice of consent, or if consent is denied, the reasons for denial. Lessor's failure to send this written notice is considered a consent to sublet.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Abandonment.</strong> If you move out of the Apartment Unit (abandonment) before the end of this Lease without the consent of Lessor, this Lease will not be ended (except as provided by law following Lessor's unreasonable refusal to consent to an assignment or subletting requested by you). You will remain responsible for each monthly payment of rent as it becomes due until the end of this Lease. In case of abandonment, your responsibility for rent will end only if Lessor chooses to end this Lease for default as provided in Article 15. In the case of abandonment, Lessor may reenter and retake possession of the Apartment Unit without any court proceedings and re-rent the Apartment Unit without freeing Individual Tenant from Individual Tenant's debts and duties assumed in signing this Lease. Lessor, at Lessor's election, may bring an action or proceeding to collect all of the rent due and owing.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
	<h2>DEFAULT</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Tenant Default.</strong> Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events, You will be in default under this Lease and Lessor shall be entitled to exercise any of the remedies provided in this Lease or otherwise available at law or equity as a result of such default:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You fail to carry out any agreement or provision of this Lease;</li>
			<li>if the Apartment shall be used or occupied by any person other than permitted under Article 1 and Article 10</li>
			<li>You or one of your Authorized Occupants of the Apartment Unit behaves in an objectionable manner;</li>
			<li>You do not take possession or move into the Apartment Unit within fifteen (15) days after the beginning of the Lease;</li>
			<li>You and your Authorized Occupants of the Apartment Unit move out permanently before the Lease ends;</li>
			<li>You fail to follow the House Rules.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If you do default in any one of these ways, other than a default in the agreement to pay rent and/or maintain the Apartment Unit as your primary or secondary residence, Lessor may serve you with a written notice to stop or correct the specified default within ten (10) days. You must then either stop or correct the default within ten (10) days, or, if you need more than ten (10) days, you must begin to correct the default within ten (10) days, and continue to do all that is necessary to correct the default as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>If you do not stop or correct the default within ten (10) days, Lessor may give you a second written notice that this Lease will end six (6) days after the date of the second written notice is sent to you. At the end of this six (6) day period, this Lease will end. You must then move out of the Apartment Unit. Even though this Lease ends, you will remain liable to Lessor for unpaid rent up to the end of this Lease, the value for your occupancy, if any, after the Lease ends, and damages caused to the Lessor, including the fees for damage and theft described in the Fee Catalogue</li>
	<li>If you do not pay your rent when this Lease requires after a personal demand for the rent has been made, or within five (5) days after a statutory written demand for the rent has been made, or if the Lease ends, the Lessor may do the following: (a) enter the Apartment Unit, including your exclusive use Bedroom, and re-take possession of it if you have moved out; or (b) go to court and ask that you and all other occupants in the Apartment Unit claiming by or through you be compelled to move out.</li>
	<li>Once your tenancy under this Lease has been ended, whether because of default or otherwise, you give up any right you might have to reinstate or renew your tenancy under this Lease.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
	<h2>REMEDIES OF LESSOR AND YOUR LIABILITY</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>If this Lease is ended by Lessor because of your default, the following are the rights and obligations of you, as an Individual Tenant, and the Lessor:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You must pay your rent until this Lease is ended. Thereafter, you must pay an equal amount for what the law calls "use and occupancy" until you actually move out of the Apartment Unit and the Apartment Building.</li>
			<li>Once you are out, Lessor may re-rent the Apartment Unit, including your exclusive use Bedroom, which may end before or after the ending of this Lease. Lessor may re-rent to a new tenant at a lesser rent or may charge a higher rent than the rent in this Lease.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Whether the Apartment Unit is re-rented or not, you must pay to Lessor as damages:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>the difference between the rent in this Lease and the amount, if any, of the rents collected in any later Lease or Leases of the Apartment Unit which, includes your exclusive use Bedroom, for what would have been the remaining period of this Lease; and</li>

		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>You shall pay all damages due in monthly installments on the rent day established in this Lease. Any legal action brought to collect one or more monthly installments of damages shall not prejudice in any way Lessor's right to collect the damages for a later month by a similar action. Each Individual Tenant shall be held liable for any such damages it has caused or permitted to be caused. If the rent collected by Lessor from a subsequent tenant of the Apartment Unit is more than the unpaid rent and damages which you owe Lessor, you cannot receive the difference. Lessor's failure to re-rent to another tenant will not release or change your liability for damages, unless the failure is due to Lessor's deliberate inaction.</li>
	<li>Individual Tenant agrees that any violation of the provisions of this Lease shall be deemed a material violation of a substantial obligation of this Lease and shall entitle the Lessor to terminate this Lease.</li>
	<li>To the extent that this Lease provides Lessor the right to seek to recover attorney's fees if a lawsuit arises under this Lease, Individual Tenant has a reciprocal right to seek to recover attorney's fees as provided for in New York Real Property Law ยง234.</li>

	<p>The receipt by the Lessor of an amount which is less than that amount of rent or additional rent owned by you shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to collect the balance.

	<h2>LATE FEE AND INSUFFICIENT FUNDS</h2>

In the event that any monthly installment of rent, or any other payment required to be made by an Individual Tenant under this lease shall be overdue by more than five (5) days, a late charge of the lesser of either (i) 5% of the monthly rent or (ii) the highest amount permitted by applicable law, may be charged by the Lessor for each month, or fraction of each month, from its due date until paid for the purpose of defraying the administrative and other costs incurred by Lessor in handling delinquent payments.</li>
